# Admiration Interactive Paper Project

This is an interactive desktop-only web project created as a collaborative effort with a diploma in computer engineering student. I was responsible for the frontend design and layout, while my collaborator wrote the JavaScript functionality for free drag-and-drop interaction.

## Project Overview
The project displays a set of “papers” with handwritten text that users can drag freely across the screen to reveal a meaningful message:

- Users can drag the paper strips anywhere on the screen on desktop and laptop devices to read the full message.  
- The project aims to inspire admiration of nature and possibilities through a simple interactive experience.  
- Note: This interaction works only on desktop/laptop devices and is not supported on mobile.

## Features

### My Contribution (Frontend)
- Designed the handwritten paper style using HTML and CSS  
- Created the layout of the paper strips with grid background  
- Styled the text and visual presentation to evoke a personal, handwritten feel

### Collaborator Contribution (JavaScript)
- Implemented the free drag-and-drop functionality for desktop browsers  
- Enabled smooth and responsive movement of paper strips on drag events

## What I Learned
- Creating visually appealing, thematic webpage layouts with HTML and CSS  
- Collaborating on interactive web projects  
- Understanding how frontend design integrates with JavaScript interactivity

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in a desktop or laptop browser  
3. Drag the papers freely anywhere on the screen to reveal the full message  

## Future Improvements
- Add mobile support or alternative interaction methods  
- Enhance animations and responsiveness  
- Explore adding audio or visual effects for greater impact
